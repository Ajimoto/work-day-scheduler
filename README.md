# work-day-scheduler

# Function (input/save)

The work day planner is designed to receive a user input in the text field and save the data stored there in local storage. It will then take the data saved and render it to the input field. This allows the user to add and remove data and have it stay in the field even after reload.

# Function (moment.js/internal clock.)

There is an integrated clock in the js logic that utilizes moment.js to display the current day and year on the page. The page then takes this data and checks to see if the time on the input fields has passed, has yet to come or is current. The page then will change the background color of the items based on those parameters.

# About Developer

My name is AJ. I am a UW Coding Bootcamp student, and this built by me for my challenge assignment. I was given basic starter code that contained a jumbotron heading and the API links already in the HTML. Provided are my links to the github repo and a deployed version of the app.
